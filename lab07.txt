1) You can add multiple public keys to an encrypted email. For example you should add yourself to the list of keys, so you can decrypt the sent message.

4) If by NSA revelation you meant reading this article, this is old news. If by revelation you mean first time I heard about these topics, I was annoyed and frankly pissed of at the goverenment. I mean like what the fuck, spying on all citizens? The government isn't supposed to be undermining our security and literally asking for backdoors to all of our private information.

5) Jesus. It's worse than I thought. The sheer ammount of data the not only have acsess to but activley process is beyond frightening. "We need acsess to the whole haystack to find the needle in the haystack" is the most idotic statement. Well right behind, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.

God damn, fuck the NSA.
