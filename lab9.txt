I am going to pull off a prank on my roomate.
He is in the Navy, clean cut, and is voting for Trump. He often leaves his computer open in our room, so I am going to change the DNS of pornhub.com to http://freeasiangays.com/ or a google search of the anarchist cookbook.

1)	Easy acsess, he has a lot to lose
2)	The after math or where he has to admit he can't get on pornhub when he is asking IT for help
3)	None, already done by just living with him
4)	If he walks in while I am doing it
5)	Wait to do it another day
